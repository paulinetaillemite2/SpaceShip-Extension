# 🚀 Space-Ship Chrome Extension Overview 

# Overview
Space-Ship is a collaborative project designed to enhance your browsing experience by transforming your new tab page into a gateway to the cosmos.   
Every time you open a new tab, you'll be greeted with a high-definition photograph provided by NASA's official API.  
Alongside the stunning visuals, you can discover the name, date, and description of the photograph when you hover over it.   
Users also have the option to save their favorite photos for later viewing, even after refreshing the page.

# Technologies Used  
⚪ HTML  
⚪ JavaScript (JS)  
⚪ Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)  
⚪ NASA API  

# Features
🌌 Dynamic NASA Photo of the Day : Each new tab displays a new, high-definition photograph from NASA.  
📷 Photo Details : Hover over the image to see the name, date, and description of the photo.  
💾 Save Favorites : Save your favorite photos and access them later, regardless of page refreshes.

# Challenges
One of the main challenges was to create a dynamic, modern, and professional interface.   
While the JavaScript and API fetch functionalities were relatively straightforward, we invested significant effort into the CSS and responsiveness to deliver an engaging and fluid user experience.
